      <h2>Always Judge a Game by its Cover</h2>
      <p>
        Donkey Kong for the Atari was released in 1981 by Nintendo. The player plays as pop culture star Mario who must save the damsel in distress: his girlfriend. During play, Mario avoids tribulations set out by Donkey Kong in the form of rolling barrels and must parkour and climb his way up to save the damsel. I chose this artifact to show the depiction of the female characters on game covers. The artifact chosen shows this game’s cover wherein Donkey Kong single handedly holds the damsel while running away from Mario. The girl is shown to be holding her hand out to Mario as a visual plea that she hopes he will save her. She is ultimately portrayed as pitiable and helpless.

      <p>
        In a study analyzing video game covers, it was found that females were depicted as weak and “the most distressing aspect of the representation of male and female characters was that, in spite of [female characters’] less frequent representation, female characters were dramatically more likely to be negatively portrayed” (Burgess et al., 2007). The weakly portrayed female character goes beyond the game and into external outlets. A video game cover in particular is an important aspect to drawing its audience because it is the unofficial start to the game; it gives the players a sneak peak into what they should expect before playing. The artifact chosen tells the player a very clear message: this game is about saving this blond-haired-red-dress-wearing maiden.
