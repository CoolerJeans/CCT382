      <h2>Curves in Combat</h2>
      <p>
The debut of Lara Croft from video game Tomb Raider set in motion a new and popular archetype for female characters. These characters are dressed in more clothes and show less skin. While this may seem like a step away from sexualizing women, these clothes were in fact designed tightly such that their unrealistic curves are more pronounced. “Characters such as Lara Croft are often portrayed in tight, revealing clothing, or as disproportionately curvaceous, essentially creating a heroine who is also a sexual object” (Summers & Miller, 2014). While some may argue that the decrease of skin shown is a step towards equality, I would argue that these characters sexualize women in a new and different sense.

      <p>
As depicted in the advertisement, Rubi Malone is sexualized for being a “tough, potty-mouthed, gun-slinging chick!” This ad shows how Rubi is being sexualized for being crude. In comparison to previously demure female characters, this archetype draws in a whole new and different audience. This archetype of character has been analysed by critics for being curvaceous. Despite the fact that they are action oriented, they are “portrayed with unusually thin arms and legs accompanying unusually large breasts” (Burgess et al., 2007). Their lack of muscles are unrealistic towards their role within the game world. While this archetype of characters was originally praised for being women empowering, they were ultimately still created for the male gaze.
