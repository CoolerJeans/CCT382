      <h2>An Introduction to this Exhibition</h2>
      <p>
It is no secret that a grand majority of early video games were created to target the male gaze. The earliest demonstration of this can be seen in arcade games, which were made in the interest of men. From hunting games to gory fights, they “largely reflected masculine pastimes” (Drenten et al., 2019). As the evolution of technology brought video games into people's homes, these gendered norms continued to be pursued. Despite this change in technology, “gender bias in video game content and gameplay [has] persisted“ (Drenten et al., 2019). Playable characters were overwhelmingly male, and females acted as side or background characters. In fact, a study shows that male game characters greatly outnumber female characters with an average ratio of three to one (Summers & Miller, 2014). Another study argues that the “most common portrayal of women was their absence” (Burgess et al., 2007). Video games have historically included a lack of female characters.       </p>
      <p>
Given that the audience of video games was male dominated, it comes as no surprise that the rare female characters were often used in ways to appeal to men and young boys. These femme characters were designed to instill certain emotions in the male audience. In some cases, these female characters have nothing to do with the game's plot except to act as eye candy. In other cases, they played the damsel in distress, a pitiable maiden in need of saving. These portrayals can be seen not only during gameplay, but in external outlets as well such as gaming magazines, advertisements, and fandoms. Advertising in particular “consistently depict women in demeaning and subjugating ways” (Drenten et al., 2019).       </p>
      <p>
In this exhibition, I hope to illustrate the different attributes and portrayals of female characters. Furthermore, to deepen the discussion on how these attributes are used to bring out certain emotions from the player or to satisfy the player's interests. I would like to explore the intended feelings that these characters bring to the player and what makes their attributes appealing. How were female characters used to attract their audience members? What aspects made them important to the game? How effective were these characters in attracting a fan base?       </p>
